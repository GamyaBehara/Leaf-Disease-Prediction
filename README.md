# 🍂 Potato Leaf Disease Classification  

This project uses **deep learning and image processing** to classify **potato leaf diseases** into **Late Blight and Early Blight**.  
A **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** is trained on a labeled dataset of leaf images to automate disease detection.  
The system scans the leaf for **pores, texture, and health** before processing the image for classification.  

### 🔹 Key Features:  
- ✅ **AI-based image classification** using CNNs  
- ✅ **Preprocessing** (resizing, normalization, and augmentation)  
- ✅ **Binary classification** (Late Blight & Early Blight)  
- ✅ **Potential for real-time deployment** via web or mobile apps
